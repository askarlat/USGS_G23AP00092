This repository contains the following scripts used to perform the analysis and create the figures in the final technical report of the USGS G23AP00092 award: 
•	MomentRegressions_Sea23.R: an R script which performs the regressions with seismic moment and creates the corresponding scatter and residual plots.
•	MagnitudeRegressions_Sea23.R: an R script which performs the regressions with moment magnitude and creates the corresponding scatter and residual plots.
